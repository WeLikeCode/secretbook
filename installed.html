      <h3>Debugging</h3>

      Please report all bugs to <a href="mailto:owencmoore@gmail.com" target="_blank">owencmoore@gmail.com</a>.

      <ul>
        <li>
          Help, it says "No message received!" when I put a message in the photo!
          <ul><li>Sometimes this happens. Try again with a slightly different message or a new photo!</li></ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          The message worked but some of the letters are wrong!
          <ul><li>Sometimes Facebook's recompression causes an error which can't be fixed by the software. Try a different photo!</li></ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Tips and FAQ</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          How secure is it?
          <ul><li>This app is a toy. Please do not use it for terrorism or other bad things (you will get caught).</li></ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          What size image should I use for maximum capacity?
          <ul><li>Before encoding, all images are resized to have maximum width and height of 960px and 720px respectively. Therefore any images this size or greater with a 4/3 aspect ratio will have the largest capacity available.</li></ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          What kinds of photos work best?
          <ul><li>High quality photos of 970px-by-720px or greater. Avoid images downloaded from the internet since these may have already been comressed multiple times. Also avoid photos with large flat areas of colour such as sky.</li></ul>
        </li>
        <li>For security purposes, only use photos you have taken yourself and destroy the original copy after creating the new version. Being able to gain access to the original image would greatly help any attacker in decoding your messages.</li>
      </ul>
